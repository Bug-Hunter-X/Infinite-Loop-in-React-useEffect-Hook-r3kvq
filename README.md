This repository demonstrates a common React bug: an infinite loop caused by incorrectly using the useEffect hook. The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from including the `count` state variable in the dependency array of `useEffect`. This creates a loop because every time `count` updates, the useEffect runs again, updating `count` and restarting the cycle. The solution demonstrates the proper usage of the dependency array.
